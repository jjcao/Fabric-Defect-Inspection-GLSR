# Fabric-Defect-Inspection-GLSR

code for Fabric Defect Inspection using Prior Knowledge Guided Least Squares Regression

1. 'main.m' in the main folder is the main file.

2. 'toolbox' includes functions called in our algorithm, such as patch segmentation, texton feature and saliency. 

3. In addition, our implementation of RRSVD, wavelet and modified are in folder: 'wnn'.

4. Other methods, such as spectral residual and context-aware saliency detection are provided by authors.

5. input data:：data\temp_7_27

6. output results：all_results

7. p.s. our running enveriment is MATLAB R2014b, then the paramater of 'bitshift.m' is different with old matlab version,please considering the valid paramater.
